## Hi there 👋

### 🤔 Who am I
- 📖 I'm Sivan Ratson, a Torah scholar (*Avrech*) based in Israel.
- 💻 I am a passionate technologist sitting at the intersection of ancient wisdom and cutting-edge code.
- 🔗 My mission is to revolutionize Torah study by bridging the gap between Jewish texts and modern software.

### 🚀 My Projects & Current Focus

- 📚 **[Otzaria](https://www.otzaria.org/)**
  
  I am the creator and lead developer of Otzaria, a modern digital library bringing Jewish texts to every device. The app serves **thousands of daily active users** and continues to grow organically.

- 🤖 **End-to-End LLM Ecosystem**
  
  I am currently architecting and deploying a comprehensive production-grade AI system.
  - **Full Stack Architecture:** Building the entire pipeline from **Model Context Protocols (MCP)** on the backend to intuitive **React** components on the frontend.
  - **Deployment:** Managing the full deployment lifecycle for complex, multi-component systems.
  - **Real-World Impact:** This system is actively used by Torah book editors for smart and deep researching, **advanced text editing**, content refinement, and **automated index generation**.

- 🔎 **AI R&D**
  
  I am developing cutting-edge applications of ML and LLMs specifically for the Torah world:
  - Semantic search using vector databases.
  - OCR for ancient Hebrew scripts.
  - **Agentic RAG** workflows.
  - Check out my models and activity on **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/sivan22)**.

### ⚙️ My Skills

- 🎓 **Exceptional Autodidact:** I possess a disciplined self-taught ability, mastering complex technologies without formal graduation but with relentless curiosity.
- 👨‍💻 **Languages:** While I have a background in C, C++, Java, and C#, my current focus is on:
  - **Python:** For Data Science, AI, and backend logic.
  - **Dart:** For cross-platform GUI applications.
  - **JavaScript/React:** For modern web interfaces.
- 🧠 **AI & ML:** Deep expertise in Python libraries (Pandas, Sklearn, PyTorch), Transformers, fine-tuning models, and orchestrating LLMs as autonomous agents.
